# Problem statement

In this workshop we learn how to implement the feature extraction transfer
learning method by taking the mobilenet network pre-trained on imagenet and
applying it to a target where the task is to classify cats and dogs. Next you will
fine tune the network to adapt it to your target. Lastly, you will learn how to
use one-shot learning for sentence encoding.
